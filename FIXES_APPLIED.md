# Cricket Match Scheduler - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Matching Logic Corrected**
- Fixed the `tryMatch()` function to properly match teams with:
  - Same day
  - Same bet amount 
  - Same ground
  - Same ground type (free/paid)
- Added detailed logging for debugging match attempts
- Ensured different teams/captains don't match with themselves

### 2. **Match Data Structure**
- Added `matches` array to data.json
- Added `captain1_confirmed` and `captain2_confirmed` fields
- Proper match status tracking (proposed → confirmed)

### 3. **Match Confirmation System**
- Enhanced `/api/match/confirm` endpoint with better logging
- Proper handling of accept/decline actions
- Automatic reopening of availability posts when match is declined
- Better status tracking for partial confirmations

### 4. **Frontend Improvements**
- Enhanced match display with opponent contact information
- Clear status messages (e.g., "WAITING FOR OPPONENT CONFIRMATION")
- Better button labels ("Accept Match" / "Decline Match")
- Improved user feedback with success/error messages
- Automatic refresh of all data after match actions

### 5. **Contact Information Display**
- Shows opponent captain name and phone number
- Available for both proposed and confirmed matches
- Chat functionality integrated

## Key Features Now Working:

✅ **Automatic Matching**: Teams with same day, bet, and ground are automatically matched
✅ **Match Confirmation**: Both captains must accept for match to be confirmed  
✅ **Contact Exchange**: Opponent captain details shown after matching
✅ **Chat System**: Real-time chat between matched captains
✅ **Status Tracking**: Clear status updates throughout the process
✅ **Decline Handling**: Declined matches reopen availability posts

## How It Works:

1. Captain posts availability (day + bet amount + ground)
2. System automatically finds matching availability 
3. Match is created in "proposed" status
4. Both captains see opponent contact info
5. Both captains must accept the match
6. Once both accept, match status becomes "confirmed"
7. Captains can chat to finalize details

The matching system now correctly identifies compatible teams and facilitates the complete match scheduling process.
