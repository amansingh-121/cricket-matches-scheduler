EMAIL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Open server.js and replace these lines:
   user: 'your-email@gmail.com'
   pass: 'your-app-password'

2. For Gmail:
   - Use your Gmail address
   - Generate App Password (not regular password):
     * Go to Google Account settings
     * Security > 2-Step Verification > App passwords
     * Generate password for "Mail"
     * Use this 16-character password

3. Example:
   user: 'captain@gmail.com'
   pass: 'abcd efgh ijkl mnop'

4. Test by creating a match - both captains will receive emails!

Note: For production, use environment variables instead of hardcoding credentials.
